## Project Information
Heart PCB is a device that uses a STM8S003K3 Microchip to do bit-level control of a set of LEDs to display an input message in half-byte binary

### Software utilites
#### STM8S003K3 Programming

Programming of the STM8S003K3 was done using ST Visual Develop (STVD) and utilized ST Visual Programming (STVP). In addition it requires the Cosmic Compilier software.
